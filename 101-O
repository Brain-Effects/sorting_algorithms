/**
 * Time complexities for the Bubble sort algorithm:
 *
 * Best case: O(n)
 *     When the input is already sorted, the time complexity is O(n) because
 *     even though no swaps will be made, the algorithm still goes through
 *     the entire array once.
 *
 * Average case: O(n^2)
 *     For each element, the algorithm goes through the rest of the array,
 *     leading to a time complexity of O(n^2).
 *
 * Worst case: O(n^2)
 *     When the input is sorted in reverse order, every pair of elements needs
 *     to be swapped, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2).
