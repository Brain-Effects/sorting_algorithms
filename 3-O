/**
 * Time complexities for the Quick sort algorithm:
 *
 * Best case: O(nlog(n))
 *     When the input is a balanced partition, the time complexity is O(nlog(n)) because
 *     the partitioning step will divide the list into two nearly equal pieces.
 *
 * Average case: O(nlog(n))
 *     This is the expected time complexity when the input is a random array or
 *     when the input contains many duplicates.
 *
 * Worst case: O(n^2)
 *     The worst case occurs when the input is an array sorted in reverse order.
